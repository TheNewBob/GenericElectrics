# GenericElectrics
GenericElectrics is an analytical constant voltage power simulation written in C++ that emphasises performance over accuracy.
It offers superficial simulations of electric circuits. 
Its aim is to provide a power simulation that is realistic and engaging enough for simulation games. 
It is therefore written in a manner that allows convenient integration into framelocked, synchronous applications.
__DO NOT__ use for any kind of scientific or academic study purposes!

Originally written for an add-on to the Orbiter spaceflight simulator, but is completely dependency free.

### State of the project
The project is mostly finished, but still needs mechanisms for event handling, and is as of yet unproven appart from a few unit tests.

## Documentation
coming soon.
